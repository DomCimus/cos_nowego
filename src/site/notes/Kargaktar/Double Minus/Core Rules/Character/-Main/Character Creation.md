## 1. Choose a Race

You can freely choose any [[Kargaktar/Double Minus/Core Rules/Character/-Main/Races List\|race]] as long as they live in the region where the campaign takes place. This information is provided by GM. So if you want to choose something different, contact GM. All races are written somewhere else.

  

## 2. Choose a Background

It determines the past of your character. It can give you bonuses in certain areas, thus giving your character some strengths and starting equipment. 

  

## 3. Determine [[Kargaktar/Double Minus/Core Rules/Character/-Main/Ability Scores\|Ability Scores]]

Much of what your character does in the game depends on abilities: Agility, Strength, Intelligence, Charisma, Will, Instinct, Constitution. Each ability has a score, which you determine by assigning one of the following scores: 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7 (Luck is 1 by default).

  

## 4. Choose [[Kargaktar/Double Minus/Core Rules/Character/-Main/Skills\|Skills]], [[Kargaktar/Double Minus/Core Rules/Character/-Main/Abilities\|Abilities]] and [[Kargaktar/Double Minus/Core Rules/Character/-Main/Feats\|Feats]]

Your character by default has 5 Learning Points (LP). You also get extra from race or defect skills (skills that make your character worse in some way). Each skill costs LP, you can have an unlimited amount of skills, but you can have only two defect skills.

  

## 5. Describe your character

Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in general terms. Choose your character’s alignment (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and ideals. Also identify the things your character holds most dear, called bonds, and the flaws that could one day undermine him or her.



## 6. Choose Equipment 

Your background determines your character’s starting equipment, including weapons, armor, and other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed somewhere below, in chapter “Equipment.“ Instead of taking the gear given to you by your background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You have a number of gold coins (cg) to spend based on your class. Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Somewhere is more information on carrying capacity.

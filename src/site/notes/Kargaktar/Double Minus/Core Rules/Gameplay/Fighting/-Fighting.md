# 1. Determine fighting order

All players (and dm for enemies) throw 1d20 to determine who goes first, who the last. If there is a draw then person with higher agility starts first. Attackers throw on advantage.

# 2. Do your turns

Now in order all players, and npc's take their turns. During your character's turn, you can perform actions, the number of actions you can perform is determined by the number of action points (AP). The cost of an action is AP + factor. While most actions always cost the same, some actions, e.g. swinging a sword, have a requirement for a given statistic of X. Not meeting the requirement results in adding +2 AP for each missing X. So swinging a sword normally costs 3 AP and has a requirement of 14 STR, but since our character only has 13 STR and does not have enough strength to swing, swinging a sword will cost him 3 + 2 = 5 AP.

# 3. Play strategical

You don't have to spend all your AP on you actions, you can save them to do reactions, witch can be done at any given moment.

# 4. Go again

When all have done their turns, then AP resets and you start form #2 and do your turns again until one side is defeated.

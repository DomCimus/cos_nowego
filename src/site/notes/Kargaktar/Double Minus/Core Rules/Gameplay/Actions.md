Action Points (PA) - these are points that determine how much your character can do during their turn. PA always on start of round go back to your default number, if not stated other wise. The amount of AP you have is determined by the [[Kargaktar/Double Minus/Core Rules/Character/-Main/Ability Scores\|Agility]] statistic, and here's the Agility to AP conversion rate:

2 - 0
4 - 1
6 - 2
8 - 3
10 - 4
12 - 5
14 - 6
16 - 7
18 - 8
20 - 9
22 - 10
24 - 11
26 - 12

# Actions:

Attack / Spell Casting - that depends but default is 3 AP .

Move 10m - first movement action is free on your turn, next cost 1 AP per 10 ft.

Dash 5m - 1 AP + req. 12 AGL (if you moved only using dash on next tour all creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you).

Prepare - 4 AP give you for next round additional 2 AP (nonstackable).

Hide - 2 AP if you are out of the enemy's line of sight you can use this to gain the advantage.

Interact with an object - 1 AP.

Disengage - 2 AP.

# Reactions:

Block - 2 AP if enemy successfully trows attack roll, then you can use this reaction to begin strength contest. If you win then you block all incoming damage, if it's a draw then incoming damage is halved. You can block only physical attacks made with melee weapons.

Dodge - 3 AP + req. 14 AGL

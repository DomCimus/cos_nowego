**Description:**
High Elves are noble and graceful people known for their extraordinary beauty and intelligence. High Elves are long-lived, often living for centuries, which grants them an air of wisdom and refinement. They dwell in grand, ethereal cities often built into natural landscapes or atop mountains, blending seamlessly with their surroundings. High Elves are also skilled artisans, musicians, and philosophers. They are proud and often seen as aloof or even arrogant by other races, valuing tradition, knowledge, and the preservation of their ancient culture above all else.

**Appearance:** 
High Elves are renowned for their ethereal and regal appearance. They are tall and slender, with an air of elegance in every movement. Their skin is often fair, radiant, or subtly luminous, with some having golden or silvery undertones. High Elves typically have long, flowing hair in shades of gold, silver, platinum, or occasionally deep black, always impeccably kept. Their eyes are large and almond-shaped, glowing with hues of blue, green, violet, or even gold, often shimmering faintly with innate magical energy. Their features are symmetrical and refined, with high cheekbones, delicately pointed ears, and graceful expressions. High Elves favor intricate and flowing attire made of fine fabrics, often adorned with subtle embroidery or gemstones that reflect their sophisticated culture.

**Description:**
Humans are a versatile race that thrives in nearly every environment. Known for their ambition and ingenuity, they are quick to adapt, learning from their successes and failures alike. While they may not possess the long lives or innate magical abilities of other races, humans make up for it with sheer determination and the capacity for great innovation. Whether as rulers, explorers, or artisans, humans leave a mark on the world wherever they go. Their societies are diverse, ranging from proud kingdoms to bustling trade cities, but all share a common trait: the unyielding desire to shape the world around them.

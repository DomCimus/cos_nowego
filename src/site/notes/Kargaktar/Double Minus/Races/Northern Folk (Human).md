**Description:**
Known for their skill in shipbuilding and navigation, they traveled widely across Middle Earth and beyond, both for trade and raiding. North Folk lived in close-knit communities centered around longhouses, where extended families shared communal spaces. Their society was organized into classes, with chieftains and warriors at the top, and farmers, craftsmen, and traders forming the backbone of daily life. Most North Folk were farmers, raising livestock and cultivating grains, but they also excelled in craftsmanship, creating intricate jewelry, weapons, and tools. They practiced a polytheistic religion, worshiping gods of war, and believed in a rich mythology filled with tales of heroism, honor, and an afterlife in green fields. Strong social bonds and a code of honor shaped their lives, emphasizing loyalty, bravery, and exploration.

**Appearance:**Â 
They were often tall and muscular, with fair skin, light-colored eyes (often blue or gray), and hair that ranged from blond to red. Men commonly wore their hair long, sometimes braided, with full beards that varied in style from braided to wild and unkempt. North Folk clothing was practical yet durable, typically made of wool, leather, and fur, layered to keep them warm. They often wore iron or bronze arm rings, amulets, and other simple jewelry as symbols of status, and many bore tattoos or war paint for intimidation in battle.

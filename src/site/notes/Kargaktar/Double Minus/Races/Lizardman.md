**Description:**  
Lizardmen are a reclusive and resilient race native to the deep swamps, marshlands, and other remote, inhospitable regions of the world. They live in small, tightly knit tribal societies that are deeply attuned to the rhythms of nature and the spirits of their ancestors. Their culture emphasizes survival, cooperation, and respect for the land, and they are known to be both fierce defenders of their territory and cunning hunters. Outsiders rarely encounter them, as they prefer to remain hidden in their watery domains, using their intimate knowledge of the terrain to avoid or ambush intruders. Oral tradition, totems, and ritual dances form the core of their spiritual life, and each tribe maintains its own customs, markings, and ancestral rites.

**Appearance:**  
Lizardmen possess a humanoid frame wrapped in scaled skin that varies in color based on their tribal lineage, ranging from deep emerald greens and mossy browns to slate grays and even vibrant turquoise hues. Their eyes are slit-pupiled and come in bright tones such as gold, amber, or crimson. They have long muscular tails for balance and swimming, and clawed, webbed feet and hands suited to traversing wetland terrain.
